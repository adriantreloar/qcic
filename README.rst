Monitor for expected messages and send out more messages if they are not received

In Development
--------------

qcic is in a pre-alpha state.

As soon as I have a minimum viable product it'll go on PyPl as an alpha version.


Features
--------

* Load a set of schedules of expected messages from one or more JSON files
* Wait for the messages to arrive...and if the messages don't arrive.
* Create an email to escalate issues to humans
